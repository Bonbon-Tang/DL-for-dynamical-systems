# DL for dynamical systems


Previously, many works has been showing the possibility of using Neural Networks to model dynamical systems. However, 
seldom of them considered different conditions of dynamical systems. The most important features of dynamical systems
might be the noise level, the measurement interval and the target of modelling. Therefore, the purpose of this project
is to show how these features change the choice of deep learning methods, such as FNN, RNNs and Transformer.
